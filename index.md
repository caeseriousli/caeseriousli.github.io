## Welcome!

I am a senior stastician at J&J Innovative Medicine. I graduated with a Ph.D. in [biostatistics](https://biostat.ucla.edu) from [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu). I conduct research with my doctoral advisors Dr. Steve Horvath, [Department of Human Genetics, School of Medicine](https://medschool.ucla.edu/human-genetics) and Dr. Gang Li, [Department of Biostatistics](https://ph.ucla.edu/departments/biostatistics). I co-first-authored a Science Magazine publication regarding large DNA methylation data classification, sparse modeling and revolutionary tree analyses. I first-authored a novel Poisson graphical model for analyzing large RNA-seq data and published the corresponding R package implemented in C++ on Github (caeseriousli/prBARgraph), and co-authored 20+ publications (Google Scholar list <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pGrR31gAAAAJ&hl=en>).

I enjoy working with high dimensional modeling, sparse modeling, machine learning algorithms (tree-based methods, deep learning, and other classfication learning), variable selection, and their applications to large genetics and health data. Programming languages: Python, R, some C++. I'm passionate about learning programming languages, new ML packages, and cool new techs on my own. And I love sharing, teching, and discussing what I learn with my peers (see my computing workshops link).
